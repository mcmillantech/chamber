<h2>Sudbury as a business location</h2>

<div class="span3">
    <p>Sudbury is an excellent place to do business. The town punches 
        well above its weight. We are home to some national brands and 
        large companies. The quality of life is first class. </p>
</div>
<div class="span3">
    <p>Our work force is excellent and can be a surprise to incomers. 
        One employer was amazed to find three generations of families working 
        in his company. And if we are 30 minutes away from major roads, 
        this is more than offset by the lack of a rush hour.</p>
</div>
<div class="span3">
    <p>There is a supportive environment. Many home grown companies have 
        achieved impressive results - 70% of the countryâ€™s silk is woven in 
        Sudbury. And Sudbury has a cluster of companies that sell to some of 
        the most prestigious clients in the world</p>
