<H3>Welcome to Sudbury Suffolk</H3>
<p style="margin-left:5%"><img src="images/MarketHill2.jpg" alt="Sudbury Market Hill" width="90%" align="center"></p>
<p>Your gateway to leisure, tourism and business in the Sudbury area. Set in the heart of the Stour Valley, an area of outstanding natural beauty, the
market town of Sudbury is an ideal centre for both business and pleasure trips
to East Anglia. Sudbury is an ancient market town dating back to Saxon times.
The ever improving road network, a rail link with Colchester to London and many
cultural and sporting facilities, fine inns and hotels, makes Sudbury an
excellent place to visit.</P>
<P>For centuries the weaving and silk industry has prospered here and many
great houses and churches have been built, giving the town a major historical
legacy. Sudbury has been used for television locations, most significantly for
BBC's Lovejoy. It is surrounded by the attractive countryside so often painted
by Constable and Gainsborough and by quintessentially English villages. It is
an ideal base for a walking holiday. </P><br>
