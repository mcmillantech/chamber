    <p>Sudbury Chamber of Commerce is a thriving example of
        effective networking in the local business community.</p>
    <p>There is a monthly lunch at the Bridge Project, Gainsborough Street at 
        which guest speakers are invited to talk on topics of interest to members.</p>
    <p>The Chamber, is run on a voluntary basis and takes up issues that effect the
        prosperity and well being of the town and its surroundings.</p>
</div>
<div class="span3">
    <p>We work extensively 
    with Sudbury Town, Babergh District and Suffolk County councils to make sure 
    business interests are recognised. We organise events to promote local business.</p>
    <p>The Chamber liaises with both Thomas Gainsborough and Ormiston Sudbury Academy 
    schools to encourage training related to achieving jobs in the commercial
    sector.</p>

    </p>
    <p>We are always happy to have new members and for as little as &pound;55 a year,
    we think this is an excellent opportunity to partake in the business community
    of Sudbury.</p>
