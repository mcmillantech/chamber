<H2>Live Music in Sudbury</H2>
Is live music dying? Not in Suffolk, it isn&#39;t. There are numerous pubs 
featuring live music every week, catering for rock, acoustic and folk. In fact 
Sudbury is almost the Hay on Wye for music. If you are visiting the area and 
like live music, we hope you find this page useful.&nbsp; If you like live music 
and don&#39;t have any at home, come and visit us anyway, it&#39;s a great place for a 
holiday (see entries on the left). Audiences 
from 18 to over 60 are catered for. The excellent magazine Grapevine (see
<a href="http://www.grapevinelive.co.uk/" target="_blank">www.grapevinelive.co.uk</a>) gives a 
pretty full listing of all gigs in East Anglia and is available in most of the 
venues listed below.

<p>Music is usually available in the following bars.&nbsp; They vary 
in character, so if one isn&#39;t to your taste another one probably will be.&nbsp; 
The entry &quot;rock&quot; includes music from the 60s through to the 90s.</p>
