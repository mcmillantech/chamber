<H3>The Sudbury Experience</H3>
<p style="margin-left:5%"><img src="images/NorthSt2.jpg" ALT="Sudbury North Street" width="90%" align="center"></p>
<P>Sudbury is a pleasant place to shop. It is an attractive unspoiled market
town. For those used to the crush of larger towns, a spell in Sudbury will be a
pleasant surprise. Access is easy, traffic queues are rare and there is plenty
of parking, all free. There is a wide range of shops with specialist small town
shops mingling with high street names. There is a popular market on Thursdays
and Saturdays. Sudbury offers a relaxed, uncrowded environment, set as it is in
the beautiful Stour valley. There are many places to eat and drink, pubs and
restaurants as well as snack bars coffee shops and fast food outlets. </P>
<P>All the banks operate full counter services and cash points. </P>
<P>The meadows surrounding Sudbury are very attractive and provide excellent
walking and picnicking. You can picnic on the grass on King's Meadow (just past
the Kingfisher leisure centre), or there is a picnic site next to the River
Stour at the Croft - a popular beauty spot. The Quay theatre (10 minutes from
the Centre) is well worth a visit. It has a bar, usually has art exhibitions
and is set in an attractive location on the Stour. </P>
<P>Parking is free. The car parks closest to the centre have a three hour
parking limit but there is ample unlimited free parking near the station. This
is a three or four minute walk from the centre. This is actually closer to the
shops than some of the car parks at Lakeside. </P>
