<H2>Doing Business in Sudbury</H2>
<P>Sudbury offers one of the most attractive working environments in the UK.
Business accommodation is cheap. The East Anglian towns and cities of
Cambridge, Norwich, Colchester and Chelmsford are all within easy reach.
Sudbury's inhabitants consider London to be the optimum distance - around 80
minutes by train. This is close enough to visit but far enough to discourage
commuters. It is set in the beautiful Stour Valley, and surrounded by
attractive villages. Property prices are modest, there are good schools and
leisure facilities. Crime is amongst the lowest in the UK.</P>
<P>Retail in Sudbury performs very well. In fact it is one of the best
performing small market towns in the UK.</P>
<P>Business services are far beyond what one would expect in a small market
town. There are numerous advisers, design companies and
suppliers. There is a mixture of commercial properties with numbers of trading
estates. The Chamber of Commerce is active and powerful. One of Sudbury's
strengths is in the relationships between the Chamber and local councils,
service providers and education.</P>
