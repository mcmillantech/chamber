hall close to their meeting place, and opposite St Peter's church. At the side
of the church is the (real) drinking trough where the 101 dalmations took a
drink when they crossed into Suffolk. In front of St Peter's church is the
statue of Thomas Gainsborough which overlooks the market place. </P>
<P>The Market Hill contains many fine buildings, now mostly converted into
shops. At the far end is the old Corn Exchange, now converted to the library,
while the opposite fork in the road leads to
<A HREF="http://www.gainsborough.org/">Gainsborough's House</A>, the home of
the artist, now an exhibition of Gainsborough's life and work together with
work from other painters.</P>
<P>Beyond the library is Friars Street, with many old buildings. 400 metres
along Friars Street is <A HREF="QuayLane.html">Quay Lane</A>, which leads to the
Quay Theatre and the Granary. </P>
<P>The centre of Sudbury contains many interesting alleys and streets. To the
North of the town hall is North Street. This is another attractive street which
is fast becoming the main shopping area of the town. It has been used as the
location for the TV Lovejoy series. North Street contains a wide selection of
shops, both national and independent. </P>
<P>Heading from the town centre towards Colchester, one crosses the one way
street and comes to Belle Vue park. This is perfect for just sitting - it has
beautiful lawns and floral displays, as well as aviaries and other collections
of animals. For the more active, there are public tennis courts and a skate
boarding area.</P>
<P>Next to the station and the long stay car parks is the Kingfisher Leisure
Centre. This has a swimming pool with a beach area, flume and wave machine. It
also has many other fitness areas.</P>
