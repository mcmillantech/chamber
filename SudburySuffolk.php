    <p>
    Set in the heart of the Stour Valley, an area of outstanding natural beauty, the
    market town of Sudbury is an ideal centre for both business and pleasure trips
    to East Anglia. Sudbury is an ancient market town dating back to Saxon times.</p>
</div>

<div class="span3">
    <p>For centuries the weaving and silk industry has prospered here and many
    great houses and churches have been built, giving the town a major historical
    legacy. Sudbury has been used for television locations, most significantly for
    BBC's Lovejoy.</p>     
</div>

<div class="span3">
    <p>It is surrounded by the attractive countryside so often painted
    by Constable and Gainsborough and by quintessentially English villages. It is
    an ideal base for a walking holiday.</p>
